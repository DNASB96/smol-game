# A small pixel art game

This personal project consists of a video game made with Unity (game engine) and Aseprite (pixel art assets).

## Goal

The goal is to make a 2D sidescroller game that would consist of a mix of platforms and "hack'n'slash" (like a metal slug game) levels as well as some boss fights in-between.
I am also considering eventually adding litte puzzles eventhough that will probably not be implemented before everything else.

## Current state of the game

The player can run using the arrow keys &#8592; and &#8594; and jump using the spacebar.
The player can also read panels using the Z key (each panel contains different dialogs).
There is a health bar as well though it isn't used for now as there is no enemies (you can use the B and N keys to heal/damage).

Here is a little preview :

## What's next?

Here is a short list of the next few things that should come soon to the game (unordered):
- background (with a parallax effect)
- simple menu + in game menu
- forest level being horizontally extended
